      "message": "Kind of, libunwind doesn\u0027t really handle the mips case very well. There are some implicit assumptions about the size of unw_word_t and the sizeof pointers. For mips, these assumptions break and they didn\u0027t do a good job of changing the places where unw_word_t means an address, and where it is really a word value. Since only mips has this issue, I don\u0027t think anyone wants to fix it.\n\nThey really should replace all places where unw_word_t is used as an address with something else.",
