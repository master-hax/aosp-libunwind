(i\u0027ve been +2ing all these changes where they\u0027re currently vendor_available, but i hope you\u0027re actually going to try to reduce the list to the ones that are *actually* needed? and for stuff like this it would be good to have the specific reason why you need it...)",

      "message": "I agree to set this property for the modules that actually need it.\nAs VNDKs are available to product, I added \"product_available: true\" to *all* VNDK libs, and the libs that is required to build the product_specific modules.\nBut I had some feedbacks that not all VNDKs are allowed to product modules. So we may remove \"product_available: true\" from the VNDK modules if they are not allowed to be used by product modules.\n\nIn this case, the `libunwind_static` and `libunwindbacktrace` are required by `libcompiler_rt` which is a VNDK and can be used by product modules. So I think this is still required.",

      "message": "ah, okay, so this is just something that rprichard will clean up for S when he switches us over to the LLVM unwinder for exception handling.\n\nis there anything in the build system that will help point out places where we can remove `product_available: true` because it\u0027s no longer used? this one\u0027s probably fine because we\u0027re actively working to remove it right now, but others are probably not going to be so obvious...",
